# ME35-Final
Operation Game Bot
This is code for an operations game playing robot!

There is a send and a receive code. 

The send code is meant to be set up on a laptop running python. It handles the conversion from image to coordinates and sends it to the Pico.
An MQTT server via mosquitto and a Droidcam needs to be set up for this to run. The corresponding IP addresses need to be input

The recieve code is to be uploaded or ran on a Pico. This handles the control of the robot.

Please see the notion pages for detailed information on the wiring diagrams.
